# New maintainer: <https://github.com/loomchild/sojourner>

**Sojourner** is a conference schedule viewer for the [Nokia N900](http://maemo.nokia.com/n900/), the smartphone of choice for the discerning sandal-wearer. Talks can be viewed by topic, by room or by time; your favourite events can be starred for easy browsing later on.

It originally showed the schedule for [FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org/); it has subsequently been made to show others, thanks mainly to wonderful contributors! It's written in *Python* and uses the [Hildon](http://pymaemo.garage.maemo.org/python_hildon_manual/) widget set. Thanks to a really shonky abstraction layer—named *Malvern*—the application also runs with plain [Gtk+](http://www.gtk.org/), though it's not beautiful.

Sojourner is no longer maintained. Merge requests, accompanied by offers to take over as maintainer, welcome on [Gitorious](https://gitorious.org/sojourner) or [GitHub](https://github.com/wjt/sojourner).
